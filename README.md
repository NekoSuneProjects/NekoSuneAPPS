## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
cd "D:/DEV/NekoSuneVRAPPS/VRChatStuff/NekoSuneOSC"
npm install
npm start
```

In VRChat, enable **OSC** (Action Menu → Options → OSC → Enabled). NekoSuneAPPS sends
to `127.0.0.1:9000` and can receive on `9001` (configurable in **Settings** — receive
must be **on** for KAT, SpotiOSC and DiscordOSC).

For multiple VRChat clients, add optional extra ports in **Settings -> OSC**. Example:
primary VRChat `9000`/`9001`, second VRChat `9002`/`9003`; add `127.0.0.1:9002` as an
extra send target and `9003` as an extra receive port.

The sidebar is grouped into **VRChat**, **Tools**, and **General**.

### Recent integrations

- **Live Typing** sends chatbox text as you type and can translate before sending.
- **Translator** supports LibreTranslate, DeepL, and Google Translate provider settings.
- **Avatar Scaling** uses VRChat's native OSC height-scaling params and supports precise
  values from `0.01` to `10000.00`, plus optional global hotkeys.
- **Localization** adds an app language picker and locale files with English fallback.
- **Multiple VRChat clients** can be targeted from **Settings -> OSC**. Keep the first
  client on `9000`/`9001`; if a second client uses `9002`/`9003`, add
  `127.0.0.1:9002` under extra send targets and `9003` under extra receive ports.
  Outgoing chatbox, params, AudioLink, KAT text, DiscordOSC, and Avatar Scaling
  messages are mirrored to extra send ports. OSC listeners can also hear the extra
  receive ports while receive is enabled or another feature is listening.
- **Now Playing status tokens** include source, elapsed time, duration, and `{songbar}`;
  the text progress bar can be styled as bars, stars, diamonds, dots, squares, or thin blocks.

## 🔑 Getting tokens & accounts

- **Pulsoid**: token at [pulsoid.net keys](https://pulsoid.net/ui/keys) with `data:heart_rate:read`.
  The Heart Rate page uses Pulsoid's redirect-free Device Authorization Flow for
  `data:heart_rate:read` only. Device posting uses a separate manually issued token
  with `data:heart_rate:write`; the two token fields are never copied or combined.
  The app client ID and read scope are configured in
  `modules/heartrate/providers/pulsoid/pulsoid.config.json`.
- **HypeRate**: request an API key from HypeRate, then enter it + your `hyperate.io/<id>` device ID.
- **Unsupported devices**: select **Other device / local bridge**, start the receiver,
  then send JSON such as `{"bpm":72}` to `http://127.0.0.1:7392/heart-rate`.
  Pulsoid-compatible `{"data":{"heart_rate":72}}` payloads and `?bpm=72` requests
  also work. Enable **Also feed readings to Pulsoid** and use a token with
  `data:heart_rate:write` if you want the same readings available in Pulsoid.
- **Bluetooth LE devices**: under **Other device / local bridge**, use **Scan nearby**
  to discover watches and monitors or **Paired / remembered** to reload devices
  previously granted to NekoSuneAPPS. Devices implementing the standard BLE Heart
  Rate Service connect directly. **GMANS WATCH** is also supported through its built-in
  proprietary protocol adapter; other proprietary watches require their own adapter.
  The last watch is cached in AppData and automatically reconnects while the app is on
  another page or hidden in the tray. A 45-second no-reading watchdog restarts stale
  GATT sessions, while live GMANS optical frames keep a measuring session alive even
  before BPM is available. Use **BLE debug log** for local scan/connect/frame diagnostics.
    An experimental screen-off handshake replay is available but disabled by default:
    captures show that its payload changes between sessions, so it is not a reliable
    substitute for opening the watch's Heart Rate screen. For GMANS firmware, enable
    **watch-side automatic heart rate** instead; this uses the official app's scheduling
    command and works with the watch screen closed. Automatic samples may be periodic or
    stored for history rather than streamed continuously.
- **Beko Smooth Heartbeat 3.x / VRC Heart Rate**: leave its OSC profile enabled and the
  app sends `VRCOSC/Heartrate/Value` plus connection, average, beat, normalized and digit
  fields from any selected provider. Only enable the legacy `HR` option for a 2.x avatar.
- **Akaryu HeartRate OSC 3.0**: sends `hr_percent`, `hr_connected`, and `hr_beat`; its
  maximum BPM is configurable and defaults to the original `hr-osc` value of 200.
- **VRChat account** (auto-status / Radar): log in on the **VRChat** tab. Handles email &
  authenticator 2FA. Your **password is never stored** — only the session cookie, locally.
- **Discord (Rich Presence)**: an Application (Client) ID from the
  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). A default ID is preset.
- **Discord (Voice Bot)**: create a **bot**, copy its **token**, use the in-app **Invite link**
  to add it to **your own private server**, and enter your Discord **user ID**. It stays invisible.
- **ShazamOSC song recognition**: enter your own token from the
  [AudD dashboard](https://dashboard.audd.io/). Audio is captured only from the screen/system
  audio source you explicitly share, then a short clip is sent to the selected provider.
  ACRCloud is also available with a project host, access key and access secret. Automatic
  mode tries configured providers in order; optional GPL `node-shazam` is detected but
  never bundled by NekoSuneAPPS.
- **TikTok**: enter the creator's `@username` while they are **live** (add a free
  [Euler Stream](https://www.eulerstream.com) key if you hit `SignatureError`).
- **Twitch**: Client ID from the [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), then
  authorize it once from **OAuth Accounts**. It requests `moderator:read:followers`, `chat:read`, and
  `channel:read:redemptions` for counters and Twitch Interactive.
- **Kick**: your channel slug (after `kick.com/`).
- **OpenAI / compatible**: an API key from your provider.
- **Translator**: choose LibreTranslate, DeepL, or Google Translate in Settings.
  LibreTranslate needs your own `/translate` endpoint; DeepL and Google need API keys.
  Live Typing can translate text before sending it to the VRChat chatbox.

## 🎛 OSC control parameters

Enable **OSC receive** in Settings, then drive these VRChat **avatar parameters** (bool):

```
SpotiOSC   /avatar/parameters/VRCOSC/Spotify/PlayPause   (also /Next /Previous /Stop)
Media      /avatar/parameters/VRCOSC/Media/Play          (also /Skip /Next /Previous)
DiscordOSC /avatar/parameters/VRCOSC/Discord/Mic         (also /Mute /Deafen)
Clock      /avatar/parameters/VRCOSC/Clock/Hours         (also /Minutes, Float 0–1)
Date/time  /avatar/parameters/DateTimeHour               (also Minute /Day /Month, Int)
OSCQR      /avatar/parameters/OSCQR/StartRecording       (also ReadQRCode; outputs QRCodeFound/Error)
ShazamOSC  /avatar/parameters/ShazamOSC/Recognize        (also LiveListening; outputs Recognized/Listening/Error/OSCTrackID/BassLevel)
```

When DiscordOSC is enabled, the app also publishes
`VRCOSC/Metadata/Modules/YUCP.VIRA.yeusepesmodules.discordosc` as a Bool.
OSCQR, SpotiOSC, and ShazamOSC publish equivalent lowercase module metadata flags.

```

Network/native code runs in the **main process** and streams updates to the renderer
via `mainWindow.webContents.send(...)`; the renderer subscribes with
`electronAPI.on('<channel>', cb)`.

## 🔋 VR gear battery (extension point)

VR battery is read through the native OpenVR runtime (`openvr_api.dll`). There is no
well-maintained pure-Node OpenVR binding, so `modules/vrchat/vr/vrBattery.js` currently
reports *unavailable*. To make it real, ship a small native helper (C#/C++ using OpenVR)
that prints device-battery JSON and spawn it from that module.

---

## 📦 Building installers

```bash
npm run build:win              # Windows nsis + msi
npx electron-builder --linux   # AppImage + deb
npx electron-builder --mac     # dmg + zip (run on macOS)
```

CI builds all three OSes on every push via
[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml). Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag also
publishes a GitHub Release with the installers attached. The app ships **no native
node-gyp modules**, so Windows/macOS/Linux all build without a C++/Python toolchain
(window-activity uses the OS's own CLI: PowerShell / `osascript` / `xdotool`).
